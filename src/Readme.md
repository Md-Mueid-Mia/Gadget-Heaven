1. **JSX Syntax**: For a clear, HTML-like structure inside JavaScript code.
2. **Components**: Reusable, modular components to structure the app efficiently.
3. **React Router**: Navigation management to create a single-page application (SPA) with dynamic routing.
4. **State Management**: Using `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useReducer` for managing component state and side effects.
5. **Context API**: For global state management across the application without prop drilling.
